Alladin is a simple static website built with HTML, CSS, and a touch of JavaScript, designed to showcase and promote electronic communication products such as smartphones, routers, and accessories. The site includes essential pages like Home, Product Listings, Product Details, About, and Contact.

Though there is no backend, the project emphasizes clean layout, responsive design, and semantic HTML structure. It demonstrates front-end development skills, focusing on user-friendly navigation and visual presentation of products.

Alladin is ideal for learning the basics of web design and structure, and can be extended with backend or e-commerce features in the future.
